# How I am defining everything

I am defining everything on my own terms for my ease of use and keeping track of what I am doing. So you are in your full rights to disagree with me, just don't complain. 

1. **issue.sh** story point is used as a pomodoro. If you don't know about pomodoro **Google** it.
2. I will update readme file as I work on this project. So don't hold your breath to see anything cool and useful. Something useful to me may not be useful to you. Accept it and move on

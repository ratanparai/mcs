## How I am defining everything

I am defining everything on my own terms for my ease of use and keeping track of what I am doing. So you are in your full rights to disagree with me, just don't complain. 

1. **issue.sh** story point is used as a pomodoro. If you don't know about pomodoro **Google** it.
2. I will update readme file as I work on this project. So don't hold your breath to see anything cool and useful. Something useful to me may not be useful to you. Accept it and move on

## Run the project
To run the project you need to -
1. Install `docker` on your machine
2. Install `docker-compose` on your machine
3. Run `docker-compose build` to build the images
4. Run `docker-compose up` to run the project
5. visit [http://localhost:5100](http://localhost:5100) for angular project, [http://localhost:5101](http://localhost:5101) for issue rest api and [http://localhost:5102](http://localhost:5102) for milestone rest api.
